                    Yet the positivist utopia was not achieved. And the world today is less controllably experts, who have mastered what they believe to be its mechanisms, than it was in the nineteenth century.         
                    <br><br>
                    What was achieved was unprecedented scientific and technical progress and, eventually, the subordination of all other values to those of a world market which treats everything, including people and their labour and their lives and their deaths, as a commodity. The unachieved positivist utopia became, instead, the global system of late capitalism wherein all that exists becomes quantifiable - not simply because it canoe reduced to a statistical fact, but also because it has been reduced to a commodity.
                    <br><br>
                    In such a system there is no space for experience. Each person's experience remains an individual problem. Personal psychology replaces philosophy as an explanation of the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Nor is there space for the social function of subjectivity. All subjectivity is treated as private, and the only (false) form of it which is socially allowed is that of the individual consumer's dream.
                    <br><br>
                    From this primary suppression of the social function of subjectivity, other suppressions follow: of meaningful democracy (replaced by opinion polls and market-research techniques), of social conscience (replaced by self-interest), of history (replaced by racist and other myths), of hope - the most subjective and social of all energies (replaced by the sacralisation of Progress as Comfort).
